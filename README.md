# Motion-Canvas-Projects
Collection of Motion Canvas Projects made by me. 

Massive thank you to people who have helped me along the way.

Projects are organized in their respective folders.

Any feedback through issues or PR's or whatever are always welcome, I always look to improve stuff.

## Stealing my code ðŸ¤ª
Go for it! Yoink my code! I encourage you in fact, just leave some comment in your code referencing this repo or me, that'll make me happy. But or else yeah, go steal my code in this repository for yourself, no need for acrediting me in any final video export anything.
